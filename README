This a arduino project in which I wanted to test the limits on what I could do with 
an arduino.

I tried to get as much led in it as I was willing to solder.
I tried to get as much text in in as I could so I would hit memory problems and needed to solve those
I wanted to use "responsive" buttons: detect combinations and click-rates and stuff
I wanted to use a state machine (or something like it)

And I wanted it to be playable.

This is a first commit.

I still need to add schema's and make shure links to orginal sources are ok.

The button class is a "fork" from a example placed on the arduino forums.
This had some issues with timing and using it on multiple buttons so i changed it to allow
use of, at least, four buttons.
